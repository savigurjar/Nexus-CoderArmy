# 📦 Instagram-like User API (CRUD using Express & MongoDB)

This is a basic Node.js REST API for managing users, similar to a small part of an Instagram backend. It performs **CRUD operations** using **Express.js** and **MongoDB with Mongoose**.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Register new user (`POST /register`)
- ✅ View all users (`GET /info`)
- ✅ View single user by ID (`GET /user/:id`)
- ✅ Update user by ID (`PATCH /user`)
- ✅ Delete user by ID (`DELETE /user/:id`)
- 📦 Validates mandatory fields on registration
- 🧪 Mongoose schema validation (lengths, required, enum, etc.)
